Group60 BUG LOG

BUG1:
description:
    didn't include the rtc.h and keyboard.h in idt.c correctly
    because we move the file concerning device into a new directory
    so we should use #include devices/keyboard.h instead of just #include keyboard.h

BUG2:
    description
        unmatched type and unmatched name
